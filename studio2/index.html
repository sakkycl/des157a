                <h2>October 2019</h2>
                <p id="paragraphs">A bullet journal is an organizational system for 
                    scheduling, reminders, to-do lists, brainstorming, 
                    and other tasks in a notebook. I started my bullet 
                    journal in 2019 during my third year of high school 
                    to be more organized and productive. It also became 
                    an amazing creative outlet. This year, my bullet 
                    journal spreads were more minimal to maintain 
                    consistency. I slowly incorporated more elements 
                    throughout the year. For example, I incorporated a 
                    habit tracker as a sticky note. I did not dedicate 
                    a whole page to the tracker because I was still 
                    finding out what spreads were useful for me.</p>
