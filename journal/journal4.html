                <p>The photo I chose shows an image of my future log spread for 
                    2024. It is interesting because of the layout of the page, such 
                    as the mini pages within the page and icons for each mini 
                    calendar. This reflects how my bullet journal has evolved over 
                    the years. This image relates to the topic of my archive 
                    because my project is about some of my favorite bullet journal 
                    spreads that I have made. The collection says something about 
                    me because it documents parts of my life. For example, the 
                    future log shows any events or important dates in my life. The 
                    theme of the spread was also inspired by a character I adore, 
                    Miffy. </p>

                </figure>

                <p>The photo shows an image of Gamcheon Culture Village. The most 
                    interest aspects of this image is the perspective, with the 
                    bright green car closest to the camera compared to the rest of 
                    the scenery. The natural sunlight and bright colors make the 
                    photo appear bustling with life. The most obvious aspect of the 
                    image is that it was taken in Korea. There is a high 
                    possibility that the project is a travel diary or a similar 
                    theme. The mysterious aspects of the image is the context, such 
                    as why the person at the village and took a photo of it. The 
                    photo makes me wonder if the person came to the location for a 
                    purpose or happened to stumblee upon it. </p>
