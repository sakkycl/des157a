                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
                    <h3>Summary</h3>
                    <p>Based on this usability test, I found that the most pressing issue 
                        is the mouse interaction. Users felt confusion on how the mouse 
                        interaction function and used the alternative interaction to 
                        navigate the website. Having text that explained how the 
                        interaction functions more clearly or including some sort of response 
                        when the action has been completed would fix this issue.</p>
                    <h3>Users</h3>
                    <p>I conducted my usability test with Kelly and Vanessa. They fit the 
                        target audience of my project because my target audience uses a 
                        bullet journal or have an interest in bullet journaling. Both users 
                        have experience with bullet journal and are more likely to look at 
                        my website.</p>
                    <p>User One: Kelly</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Age: 22 years old</li>
                        <li>Gender: Female</li>
                        <li>Education:<ul>
                            <li>UC Davis</li>
                            <li>4th year</li>
                            <li>Design major</li>
                        </ul></li>
                        <li>Bullet journal: Yes!</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>User Two: Vanessa</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Age: 21 years old</li>
                        <li>Gender: Female</li>
                        <li>Education:<ul>
                            <li>UC Davis</li>
                            <li>4th year</li>
                            <li>Data Science major</li>
                        </ul></li>
                        <li>Bullet journal: Yes!</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Tasks</h3>
                    <p>For the usability of my project, I want to focus on improving the 
                        mouse interactions of my website. In my usability test, the main 
                        task I asked users to do was to look through all the pages of the 
                        website. This allowed me to observe if users make use of the 
                        mouse interactions and how easily they were able to utilize it.</p>

                    <h2>Results</h2>
                    <h3>Bugs</h3>
                    <p>Throughout the usability test, I noticed that the user interactions 
                        function and they should. I did not notice any bugs or broken parts 
                        of the experience.</p>
                    <h3>Usability Problems</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Users tried to press and swipe over images</li>
                        <li>Users hover over the image randomly</li>
                        <li>Users had trouble noticing the page had changed</li>
                        <li>Users did not notice when the task has been completed</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Other Feedback</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Users relied on the button more than the swipe feature</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Post-Test Questions</h3>
                    <p>After the usability test, I asked post-test questions about what they 
                        liked and disliked about the experience. I was told that they liked 
                        that there was only one main interaction but disliked that they 
                        could not go back to a page if they wanted to. I also received 
                        feedback about how the text is a bit overwhelming and it would be 
                        helpful if it was broken into shorter paragraphs.</p>
