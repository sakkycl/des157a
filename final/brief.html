                <h2>Project Summary</h2>
                <p>I choose my Every Picture project for my final project because I think I 
                    can make many changes in functionality, design, and usability to 
                    improve it.</p>
                <h2>Project Description</h2>
                <p>For the functionality of my project, I am considering adding a 
                    navigation menu for the different pages on my website. My current 
                    website only allows users to go through the images in a certain order. 
                    Being able to click on the images that the user wants to see would 
                    improve the functionality of my overall website.</p>
                <p>For the design of my project, I am considering make changes to my 
                    original website design to improve its legibility. This includes 
                    increasing the line height of the text, having more white space between 
                    elements, and possibly changing the background to one that is more 
                    minimal and less busy.</p>
                <p>I plan to focus on the usability of my project. For usability, I want to 
                    improve the mouse interactions of my website. My original website was 
                    too sensitive to the mouse movements and made the image change even if 
                    the user did not intend to change the image. I plan to fix this issue 
                    in this project.</p>
                <h2>Expert Feedback</h2>
                <p>Since I am focussing on the usability of my project, I plan to create a 
                    usability report. I plan to do usability testing with the audience of my 
                    website. I think my audience are those who bullet journal or have an 
                    interest in bullet journaling.</p>
