                <h2>October 2019</h2>
                <p id="paragraphs">A bullet journal is an organizational system for 
                    scheduling, reminders, to-do lists, brainstorming, 
                    and other tasks in a notebook. I started my bullet 
                    journal in 2019 during my third year of high school 
                    to be more organized and productive. It also became 
                    a creative outlet. This year, my bullet 
                    journal spreads were more minimal to maintain 
                    consistency. I slowly incorporated more elements 
                    throughout the year such as a 
                    habit tracker as a sticky note. I did not dedicate 
                    a whole page to the tracker because I was still 
                    finding out what spreads were useful for me.</p>
